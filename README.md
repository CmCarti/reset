## Reset Grid
The reset grid works much the same as the bootstrap grid. It was built with Flexbox and is pretty flexible with spacing and alignment. 

### Structure
```HTML
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col col-6">
            column content
        </div>
        <div class="col col-6">
            column content
        </div>
    </row>
</div>

```
